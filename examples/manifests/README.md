# Shipyard Manifests

----

Shipyard manifests contain the examination of the payloads that the shipyard api will receive.
A complete manifest will consist of multiple yaml file's assembled in some way. Each yaml file will follow
Kubernetes style artifact definition.

The high level expectation of what the data on this manifests will define is pictured here :

## region_manifest.yaml

Region is the largest resource shipyard can understand.
A region manifest will need to define :

- Identity of the Region. Perhaps a name will suffice, but a UUID generated by shipyard might be applicable as well.
- Cloud : The type of cloud this region is running on. i.e. AIC, or AWS, or Google etc.
- deployOn : Whether the region UCP ( undercloud) is been deployed on VM's or Baremetal

## servers.yaml

----
## network.yaml

----
## hw_definition.yaml

----
## host_profile.yaml

----
## services.yaml

Will define high level needs for all the services that need to run above the undercloud

It relates to the files :

## core_services.yaml
## clcp_services.yaml
## onap_services.yaml
## cdp_services.yaml


----
## undercloud.yaml

This file will incude the configuration aspects of the undercloud that are tunnables.
Such as :
i.e.
-Security 
-RBAC definitions
-Certificates
-UCP Tunnables
-Kernel Tunnables, etc
-Agent Tunnables
